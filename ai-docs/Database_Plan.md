I'm thinking about creating a new page called "Chat" that is very similar to the current "test" page. The test page currently allows users to:

1) Enter their API Key
2) Send a prompt to the API
3) Get a response from the API

In theory, I want to do the same thing, but I want to scale this out further. I'd like to do the following:

1) Enter their API Key
2) Maintain a "chat history" separated by "tabs" that would exist on a lefthand vertical bar
3) Users can click back into an old chat to continue the chat

To accomplish this, I need the following:

1) Duplication of code from test to new "chat page" for basic functionality
2) Improved UI similar to what you would see on www.venice.ai/chat in the "chats" section. This includes the lefthand history bar that I mentioned
3) A toggle on the top of "save chat history" being enabled or disabled. There must be a note when clicked "you are choosing to save your chat history in a database. It can only be accessed via your API key"
4) Development of a database to store this data. The database must have columns for: API Key, Chat, Text, Sequence. For every new chat prompt that is sent and response received, it must be added to the database.
5) The "chat" titles must be pulled when someone enters the page, but the actual context should only be pulled when a user clicks on the chat
6) MOST IMPORTANT: The chat history must never be exposed to anyone, other than the informatoin from the individual API key that is set within the UI

What I need:
Identify all the options for this database and think about how this can work efficiently. Identify various providers who I can use for this. Evaluate security, latency, usability (will it work with what I want to do) and price and provide a summary as well as a recommendation. I am willing to build this myself - but you need to identify that as one of the options, and what I should build it through.

## Detailed AWS RDS Setup Guide

### Prerequisites
- AWS account with billing set up
- Basic knowledge of AWS services
- AWS CLI installed and configured (optional)

### Step 1: Create a PostgreSQL RDS Instance

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console (https://console.aws.amazon.com/)
2. Navigate to the RDS service (use the search bar or find it under Database services)
3. Click "Create database"
4. Choose database creation method:
   - Select "Standard create"
5. Engine options:
   - Choose "PostgreSQL"
   - Version: PostgreSQL 14 or higher
6. Templates:
   - Select "Free tier" for testing or "Production" for a production environment
7. Settings:
   - DB instance identifier: `chat-history-db`
   - Master username: `db_admin` (or your preferred username)
   - Master password: Create a strong password and save it securely
8. Instance configuration:
   - For production: db.t3.small (2 vCPU, 2GB memory)
   - For testing/development: db.t3.micro (1 vCPU, 1GB memory)
9. Storage:
   - Allocated storage: 20 GB
   - Enable storage autoscaling
   - Maximum storage threshold: 100 GB
10. Availability & durability:
    - For production: Create a standby instance (Multi-AZ)
    - For testing/development: Don't create a standby instance
11. Connectivity:
    - VPC: Default VPC or your custom VPC
    - Public access: Yes (for easy development) or No (for production security)
    - VPC security group: Create new or select existing
    - Availability Zone: No preference or choose specific
    - Database port: 5432 (default)
12. Database authentication:
    - Password authentication
13. Additional configuration:
    - Initial database name: `chat_history_db`
    - Backup: Enable automated backups
    - Backup retention period: 7 days
    - Monitoring: Enable enhanced monitoring (for production)
    - Maintenance: Select a maintenance window during low-traffic hours
    - Deletion protection: Enable (for production)
14. Review all settings and click "Create database"

### Step 2: Configure Security Group

1. After the database is created, go to its details page
2. Under "Connectivity & security", click on the VPC security group link
3. In the security group page, select "Inbound rules" tab
4. Click "Edit inbound rules"
5. Add a rule:
   - Type: PostgreSQL (port 5432)
   - Source: Custom with your application's IP range/CIDR
   - For development: You can use your IP address or 0.0.0.0/0 (not recommended for production)
6. Click "Save rules"

### Step 3: Get Connection Information

1. Go back to your RDS instance details
2. Note the following information:
   - Endpoint: This is your database host (e.g., `chat-history-db.abcdefg.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com`)
   - Port: 5432 (default PostgreSQL port)
   - Initial database name: `chat_history_db`
   - Master username: The username you specified
   - Master password: The password you created

### Step 4: Set Up Project with RDS Connection

1. In your project directory, run the database setup script:
   ```bash
   npm run db:setup
   ```
2. Enter the RDS connection information when prompted
3. Let the script create the .env file and run migrations

### Step 5: Verify Connection

After the setup is complete, you can verify the connection by:

1. Starting your application:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
2. Navigate to the Chat page
3. Enter an API key
4. Toggle "Save Chat History" to enable
5. Send a message to verify that chat history is being saved

   - Created a secure API key handling system with hashing
   - Implemented data-isolation to ensure users can only access their own data
   - Added error handling and input validation

3. **Frontend**:
   - Developed a Chat page component with sidebar for chat history
   - Implemented chat history toggle functionality
   - Added UI for creating, selecting, and deleting chats
   - Created real-time message rendering

4. **Setup and Documentation**:
   - Created a database setup script for easy configuration
   - Documented RDS setup process with detailed instructions
   - Provided alternatives analysis for different database options
   - Added instructions for migrating and initializing the database

### Next Steps

To complete the implementation:

1. Create an AWS RDS PostgreSQL instance following the detailed instructions
2. Run the database setup script to configure the connection:
